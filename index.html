          <h2>Want to know more about me and how I got here?</h2>
          <p>
            I started at Admiral back in 2016 with the Renewals department. I managed to work though several different roles from being first point of contact on the phones and website to a trainer out in Halifax, Canada. 
            The opportunity came about to enter the IT department through an extensive course with further training  on the job. After a few weeks of interviews and video calls I received the call to accept me onto the course! 
            You will be able to follow my progress and development with the blog that I will keep up to date below.
          </p>
            <h4>Week 1</h4>
            <p>
              In the first week of the course we were introduced to visual studio and the git-hub where would be logging the projects and making the start of our portfolio. 
              Part of the first week was being taught how to write basic code with HTML and CSS for the styling of the website. Towards the end of the week we were given the project,
              of putting all we had learnt in the first few days and applying it to coding a website which we would keep up to date and develop and update throughout the course.

          <h4>Week 2</h4>
          <p>
            This second week I we have been working on the Agile framework and how to apply it to the role. On top of that we have also been introduced to Trello to assist us with the use of Scrum and managing tickets.
            Take a look at the project I have been working on for a new state of the art health symoptom tracker, you will be able to see my progress here.</p>

      <h2>Course Information</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Basic Programming</b>: You’ll perform the role of a developer, learning the basics of programming in HTML, CSS and even some JavaScript. You certainly won’t be measured as full time coders by the end of the course, but you’ll have enough to get started and give you hands on experience of life as a programmer.
        <br><b>Life in a Tech team</b>: We’ll cover Agile from its founding principles as well as best practices relating to the delivery of tech projects. This will include the practical day-to-day processes of Scrum as well as a deeper understanding of how requirements are created, investigated, developed, tested and verified as completed in tech projects.
        <br><b>Testing</b>: Arguably the most important part of Software Development. What are all the ways we test a product? Why are we testing? How can we check that our tests are adding value?
        <br><b>Deployment/Maintenance</b>: OK so we’ve got the requirements, built the product, tested it works in isolation. But how do we make it accessible to users? Where does the product go, and how do we make sure it keeps working?
